/**
 * This class is designed to clean up resources after tck test.
 *
 * <p>Implementation should be defined in {@link TckModule}. It can be defined common for all tests
 * or test specific by using @Named annotation. Cleaning of resources is invoked after finish of all
 * tests methods from one test suite that should contains one and only one tck test class.
 *
 * <p>The usage example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class MyTckModule extends TckModule {
 *     public void configure() {
 *         bind(TckResourcesCleaner.class).to(...);
 *         bind(TckResourcesCleaner.class).annotatedWith(Names.named(SomeTest.class.getName())).to(...);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
