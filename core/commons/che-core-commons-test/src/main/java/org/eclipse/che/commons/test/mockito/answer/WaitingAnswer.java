/**
 * Answer class that helps to lock execution of test in separate threads for testing purposes.
 *
 * <p>It can hold waiting thread until this answer is called.<br>
 * It can hold waiting thread that uses mock until answering to mock call is allowed.
 *
 * <p>Here is an example of complex test that ensures that (for example) locked area is not called
 * when other thread try to access it.
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *     // given
 *     WaitingAnswer<Void> waitingAnswer = new WaitingAnswer<>();
 *     doAnswer(waitingAnswer).when(someClassUsedInTestedClass).someMethod(eq(param1), eq(param2));
 *
 *     // start doing something in a separate thread
 *     executor.execute(() -> testedClass.doSomething());
 *     // wait until separate thread call answer to find the moment when critical area is occupied
 *     // to make test fast wait not more that provided timeout
 *     waitingAnswer.waitAnswerCall(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 *
 *     // when
 *     try {
 *         // start doing something in current thread
 *         testedClass.doSomething()
 *         // this area should not be reachable until answer is completed!
 *         fail("Error message");
 *     } finally {
 *         // In this case exception can be suppressed
 *         // Test is simplified to provide clean example
 *
 *         // then
 *         // complete waiting answer
 *         waitingAnswer.completeAnswer();
 *         // ensure that someMethod is called only once to confirm that testedClass.doSomething()
 *         // doesn't call it this particular test
 *         verify(someClassUsedInTestedClass, timeout(100).times(1)).someMethod(any(), any());
