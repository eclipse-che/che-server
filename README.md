# What is Che server
Che Server provides an API for managing Kubernetes namespaces, and to retrieve devfile content from repositories,
hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Microsoft Azure Repos.

# Project structure
Che Server is mostly a Java web application deployed on an Apache Tomcat server in a container. Che Server uses the following modules:     
### OAuth1 / OAuth2 API implementations
- wsmaster/che-core-api-auth
- wsmaster/che-core-api-azure-devops
- wsmaster/che-core-api-bitbucket
- wsmaster/che-core-api-github
- wsmaster/che-core-api-gitlab
### Factory flow implementations
- wsmaster/che-core-api-factory-azure-devops
- wsmaster/che-core-api-factory-bitbucket
- wsmaster/che-core-api-factory-bitbucket-server
- wsmaster/che-core-api-factory-github
- wsmaster/che-core-api-factory-gitlab
- wsmaster/che-core-api-factory-shared
### Kubernetes namespace provisioning
- infrastructures/kubernetes
- infrastructure/openshift
- infrastructures/infrastructure-factory

Other modules are deprecated and will be removed in the future.

# Build requirements
- Apache Maven 3.9 or later
- JDK 11
- Podman or Docker (required for running integration tests)

# Sources build
Run `mvn clean install` to build. Activate a faster profile build by adding `-Pfast`.

You can skip enforcers, validators, and tests with:

```
mvn clean install -V -B -e -Pfast -DskipTests -Dskip-validate-sources -Denforcer.skip=true -Dmaven.repo.local=.repository/
```

# Image build and push
1. Go to the `dockerfiles` directory.
2. Run `./build.sh`.
3. Tag the **che-server** image with your account: `docker tag quay.io/eclipse/che-server:next <docker registry>/<your account>/che-server:next`.
4. Push the **che-server** image to your account: `docker push <docker registry>/<your account>/che-server:next`.

# Debug
1. Deploy Che to a [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/stable/administration-guide/installing-che-on-openshift-using-cli/) or [Minikube](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/stable/administration-guide/installing-che-on-minikube/) cluster by using a previously built image: `chectl server:start --platform=<openshift / minikube> --cheimage=<docker registry>/<your account>/che-server:next`.
2. Enable local debugging of the Eclipse Che server: `chectl server:debug`.
3. In your IDE, create a new Remote JVM Debug configuration on `localhost:8000`.
4. Hit a breakpoint in the code and activate the debug configuration.


# CI
