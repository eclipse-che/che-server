# What is Che server
Che Server is a core component of the [Eclipse Che](https://github.com/eclipse/che/). This component is responsible for creation and managing of Che workspaces, but will some day be replaced by the [Dev Workspace Operator](https://github.com/devfile/devworkspace-operator). 

# Project structure
Che Server is mostly a Java web application deployed on a Apache Tomcat server in a container. 
- ['pom.xml'](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server/tree/main/pom.xml) The root Maven module, that lists all dependencies and structure. 
- ['assembly'](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server/tree/main/assembly) - module for final assemblies of Che web applications
- ['dockerfiles'](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server/tree/main/dockerfiles) - directory contains image Dockerfile for Che Server, as well as additional images.
- ['core'](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server/tree/main/core) - core and utility modules for Che.
- ['wsmaster'](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server/tree/main/wsmaster) - primary modules of the Che Server API.
- ['multiuser'](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server/tree/main/multiuser) - modules related to multiuser implementation of Che.
- ['infrastructure'](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server/tree/main/infrastructure) - implementations for the underlying infrastructure, on which Che is running (Kubernetes, Openshift, etc.)
- ['deploy'](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server/tree/main/deploy) - deployment files for Helm installation.
- ['typescript-dto'](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server/tree/main/typescript-dto) module, that provides DTO objects for typescript projects that may depend on Che Server, such as Che Theia.

# Build requirements
- Apache Maven 3.6.3 or Higher
- JDK Version 11
- Podman or Docker (required for running integration tests)

# Sources build
Run `mvn clean install` to build. Activate a faster profile build by adding `-Pfast`

# Image build and push
1. Go to the `dockerfiles` directory.
2. Run `./build.sh`.
3. Tag the **che-server** image with your account `docker tag quay.io/eclipse/che-server:next <docker registry>/<your account>/che-server:next`.
4. Push the **che-server** image to your account `docker push <docker registry>/<your account>/che-server:next`.

# Debug
1. Deploy Che to [an openshift cluster](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/stable/administration-guide/installing-che-on-openshift-using-cli/) or [minikube](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/stable/administration-guide/installing-che-on-minikube/). Use the previously built image: `chectl server:start --platform=<openshift / minikube> --cheimage=<docker registry>/<your account>/che-server:next`  
2. Enable local debug of Eclipse Che server: `chectl server:debug`.
3. In your IDE create a new Remote JVM Debug configuration on `localhost:8000`.
4. Hit a breakpoint in the code and activate the debug configuration.


# CI
